# Demise-Assistant-Python
An alternative to Demise-Assistant-Batch made entirely in Python for more capabilities.
___
## IMPORTANT NOTE
Demise-Assistant-Batch will NOT be removed or archived, it is just a less-capable version, like a prototype. I do advise using this version since it will have much more capabilities than its prototype.
___
## Dependencies
The assistant requires Python installed with the Python package 'pyttsx3' installed as well.
To install 'pyttsx3', do 'pip install pyttsx3'. It might download dependencies that it needs.
___
## Usage
Run the 'Assistant.py' file as everything is accessible from that file.
